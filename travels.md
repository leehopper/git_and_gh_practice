## Favorite Vacation - Baja Road Trip

Two close friends and I flew into San Diego, walked across the border to Mexico and picked up a rental car, and drove all the way down Baja to Cabo over the course of a week. We got to see so many places completely off the typical tourist path and really experience the Baja culture. We stayed in a variety of Airbnbs in the different towns, and met some incredible hosts. Street tacos in the small towns along the way may of been the biggest highlight though!
